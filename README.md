A Bootstrap theme for 1337 h4x0rs. Inspired by the classic green on black terminal style. This theme will make your website 1337.

Check out the [example site](http://brobin.github.io/hacker-bootstrap/)!


## Usage

You can pick up the latest [hacker.css](http://brobin.github.io/hacker-bootstrap/css/hacker.css) and reference the css in your page.

```html
<link href="css/hacker.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

**Or** you could be a real h4x0r.

**H4X0RS ONLY**

Make sure you have bootstrap and less installed (they're listed as dependencies in `package.json`). Open up your h4x0r terminal and type the following:

```bash
$ npm install
```
Then compile by using the 1337 compile script:

```bash
$ npm run build
```
